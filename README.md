# Zotero-JavaScript-Search-Client
Example HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for searching for items within a public Zotero user or group library

## Motivation

To help users discover your publications, you can add them to an online database like Zotero and then present a search interface to that database on your website. Modules for doing so have been written for WordPress and Drupal, but I hadn't seen one for static HTML sites, so I wrote this example to test how feasible a static HTML Zotero client would be to implement.

For usage and examples, see [the documentation](https://ble-lter.github.io/Zotero-JavaScript-Search-Client/).
